the URL of the target page; we will then be able to start sending your likes within the hour. Works best when

quality, credibility, and worth when it has a lot of likes. Should the same post have no likes, the same favourable
view would not be held. Your posts have greater chance to have the intended impact the more likes they get.

spam likes from bogus accounts; you can find yourself kicked from the network. Getting 100% real likes is not
governed by any policies or limitations. That is exactly as long as they originate from actual individuals. We
therefore ensure their legitimacy, hence Getting our Facebook likes is secure.

people who supplied them are closed down, either by Facebook or on their own initiative. We can guarantee their
lifetime as we only obtain likes from genuine, live accounts run by actual individuals. For further piece of mind, we
additionally cover every transaction with a first 60-day retention guarantee.
